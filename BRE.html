            <h3>Information on the Mathematics:</h3>
            <p><u>The shapes:</u><br>In geometry, a common question is to ask what shapes exist that obey certain criteria.
                For example, we might ask 'In 2D, how many four sided shapes are there?' 
                and for this we would look at the set including shapes such as the square, rhombus, trapezium, 
                isosceles trapezium, rectangle, parallelogram, kite, and irregular quadrilateral. We could then 
                add a second layer of rules to this making the criteria stricter. Let's say we only want shapes 
                with at least two equal sides. The set then contains the square, rhombus,  
                isosceles trapezium, rectangle, parallelogram, and kite. Next, we could say that we want all four sides to be equal leaving only 
                the square and the rhombus. Finally, we ask that all of the internal angles are equal, leaving only the square</p>
                <p>Each rule we have added has cleaned up the set, taking out the more lopsided shapes 
                    and leaving only the most symmetric behind. If we use these steps on the set of n-sided shapes, then we get one shape left over, 
                the regular n-gon.</p>
                <p>The shapes displayed on this page are in essense the 3D and 4D versions of this 'most symmetric' idea. For 3D we only have 5, 
                    romantically named 'the Platonic Solids' and revered by the Ancient Greeks (and modern geeks) for their beauty. The 4D shapes are knwon as the 
                convex regular polytopes. They are mostly four dimensional versions of each of the Platonic Solids. However in 4D there also exists the Hyper-Diamond, 
                which has no equivalents in any other dimensions!</p>
            <p><u>The mathematics:</u><br>Everything here is done with basic linear algebra. 
                Each shape is represented by a set of vectors such that each vector represents the position of a vertex of the shape.
                Once this set of vectors in known, rotation matrices can be used on each vector to find where each vertex will be after the rotation.
                That is how the larger, discrete rotations are done. 
                The mouse following rotations however are done a little differently. There is a vector coming from the centre of the shape 
                and ending at the screen. We shall call this the 'forward vector'. When the mouse is moved, we change the forward vector to go from 
                the centre of the shape to where the mouse is on the screen. With this as our new forwards direction we can calculate what the new left-right 
                and up-down direction must be. The vertex vectors contained numbers telling us how for right, up, and fowards to come to get to the vertex. 
                If we use these numbers with the new direction vectors, we get the shape rotated to always face the mouse!</p>
            
            <br><br>
            <h3>Information on the programming:</h3>
            <p><u>The Goal:</u><br> I had three main goals in mind for this peice. 1) I wanted to try using mathematics to render something 
            interesting in canvas. 2) I wanted to work out how correctly display the shapes in perspective. 
            3) I wanted to figure out the mathematics and programming required to make something rotate to always face the mouse.</p>
            
            <p><u>What I learned</u><br> I'd say I achieved my goals and I certainly learned a lot. During this peice I figured out how to size elements 
            to nice aspec ratios using the viewport height and width. This peice was also where listening events clicked for me after I did some experiments to understand 
            their syntax and the nature of passing a function as a reference.</p>
